# Warp Core
Warp Core is a performance-focused modpack for Minecraft that prioritizes optimization and stability while still providing a rich gameplay experience. Designed to serve as a foundation for other modpacks, Warp Core includes a suite of mods that work together to enhance Minecraft's performance, reduce lag, and increase FPS.

Warp Core's lightweight and stable design make it a perfect base for other modpacks. Modpack creators can use Warp Core as a foundation to build their own modpacks, adding or removing mods as needed without worrying about performance issues or compatibility problems.

### Dont ask about the plushes and Bl√•haj!!!
